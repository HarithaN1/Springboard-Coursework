# Springboard Data Science Mini-Projects

Welcome! This repository contains my data science mini-projects, ranging from data wrangling and statistical inference to machine learning and data visualization.

### Data Wrangling

**JSON Exercises:** The dataset on the World Bank projects is available in a JSON file. I first load the data as a Pandas dataframe and find that China, Indonesia and Vietnam have the most projects with the World Bank. Then I load the JSON file as a string, normalize the project themes, and find that environment and natural resources management, rural development and human development are the project themes with the highest frequencies. 

**XML Exercises:** The Mondial database contains geographical terrains and various physical features in the world. I use `xml.etree.ElementTree` module to parse the data, which are stored as elements in a hierarchical structure. Each element has a tag, a number of attributes, a text string, and a number of child elements. I find that (1) Monaco, Japan and Bermuda have the lowest infant morality rate; (2) Shanghai, Istanbul and Mumbai have the largest city population; (3) Han Chinese, Europeans and Indo-Aryan are ethnic groups with the largest overall population, and (4) the longest river in the world is Amazonas, the largest lake is Caspian Sea, and the airport at the highest elevation is El Alto International.
